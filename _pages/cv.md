Education
======
* M.Eng. in Computer and Information Engineering, University of Cambridge, 2025
* B.A. in Computer and Information Engineering, University of Cambridge, 2024
  
Work experience
======
* Summer 2024: ML Research Engineer Intern
  * Autodesk Research, London
  * Topic: Few-step diffusion model for 3D Computer Vision. Generating 3D bodies as CAD b-reps.
  * Held a presentation outlining findings and how this method improves the latency and reduces costs in deployment.
  * Supported the team by submitting and evaluating PRs, reporting issues, and providing support with debugging.
  

* Summer 2023: ML Research Intern
  * CS department, University of Cambridge
  * Topic: Federated Learning. Allowing straggler clients to optimally offload computation to other clients. Dropped the training time by 30% and reduced straggler prevalence by 15X.
  * An agent splits the neural networks for minimizing the training time. It combines heuristic scheduling, PPO and split learning with any FL strategy.
  * The heuristic-based approach matches prior RL methods that suffered of the curse of dimensionality, thus applicable to a few devices(<6). The proposed method can be applied for thousands of clients.
  

* Summer 2022: Hardware Engineer Intern
  * Qualcomm R&D Lab, Cambridge
  * Topic: I worked in 2 projects, one focused on PCB design, and one on software development.
  * In the PCB project, I designed an internal board from scratch and implemented it in ECAD.
  * I developed a GUI application that automates internal processes of circuit testing by serial communication with dedicated instrumentation. The test time was dropped from 1h to 3 minutes.
